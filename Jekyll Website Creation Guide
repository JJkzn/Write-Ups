We use the jekyll-theme-chirpy i.e Chirpy Theme for our website

1 - Create a new repository with the publicly available Chirpy Starter - https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter
    On the page click - "Use this template" then "Create a new repository".

2 - As per standard for github pages I named my website - JJkzn.github.io

3 - Clone your newly created repo to your local machine - git clone https://github.com/JJkzn/JJkzn.github.io.git

4 - I then launched the newly cloned repo in Visual Studio Code - (Quickly accomplished by typing       code .       into the git CLI)

5 - Build the dependencies for the site with the command - bundle        (in windows CMD LINE)

6 - Start the web server on your local host -        bundle exec jekyll serve        - find the web server at localhost:4000
