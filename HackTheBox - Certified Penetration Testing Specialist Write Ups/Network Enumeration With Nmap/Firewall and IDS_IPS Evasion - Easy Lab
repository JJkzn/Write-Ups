*CONTEXT*

A company hired us to test their IT security defenses, including their IDS and IPS systems.
Our client wants to increase their IT security and will, therefore, make specific improvements to their IDS/IPS systems after each successful test. 
We do not know, however, according to which guidelines these changes will be made. Our goal is to find out specific information from the given situations.

We are only ever provided with a machine protected by IDS/IPS systems and can be tested. 
For learning purposes and to get a feel for how IDS/IPS can behave, we have access to a status web page at:

http://<target>/status.php

This page shows us the number of alerts.
We know that if we receive a specific amount of alerts, we will be banned.
Therefore we have to test the target system as quietly as possible.

----

CHALLENGE OBJECTIVE - Our client wants to know if we can identify which operating system their provided machine is running on. Submit the OS name as the answer. 

-----

Okay, so first we must determine the firewalls and their rules.

sudo nmap 10.129.55.254 -p1-100 -sA -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace

This resulted in no output from the target, all our requests were completely ignored and we registered about 50 alerts on the system. NOT GOOD!
Let's rethink our strategy.

--
How about we do a scan on some common ports while utilising decoys to help obfuscate our own IP and scans.

sudo nmap 10.129.55.254 -p21,22,80 -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace -D RND:5

HUZZAH! We got some real results this time and we didnt cause any IPS/IDS alerts to be registered by the system!
Looking at these scan results we can see two open ports - 22 and 80. Let's focus on these two.

------
We used the following command to get the OS version name:

sudo nmap 10.129.2.80 -p 80 -sS -Pn -n -sV --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace -D RND:5

In this command we are targeting port 80 with a TCP-SYN scan, with disabled ICMP Echo requests, disabled DNS resolution, disabled ARP-Ping Requests, traced packets and a number of random Decoys - most of these commands are set to help obfuscate our scanning and prevent the IDS/IPS from banning us.

The snipped section of the results shoiwng us the OS name are seen below:

NSE: TCP 10.10.15.118:34836 > 10.129.2.80:80 | CLOSE
NSOCK INFO [26.1240s] nsock_iod_delete(): nsock_iod_delete (IOD #8)
