diningroom

After reaching the room, Jill and Barry started their investigation

Blood stein can be found near the fireplace. Hope it is not belong to Chris.

After a short investigation with barry, Jill can't find any empty shell. Maybe another room?

There is an emblem on the wall, will you take it? YES
WE FIND THIS STRING - 		<!-- SG93IGFib3V0IHRoZSAvdGVhUm9vbS8= -->
THIS IS BASE64
WE DECODE IT AND IT SAYS - How about the /teaRoom/

Look like you can put something on the emblem slot, refresh /diningRoom/

What the freak is this! This doesn't look like a human.

The undead walk toward Jill. Without wasting much time, Jill fire at least 6 shots to kill that thing

In addition, there is a body without a head laying down the floor

After the investigation, the body belong to kenneth from Bravo team. What happened here?

After a jiff, Barry broke into the room and found out the truth. In addition, Barry give Jill a Lockpick.

Barry also suggested that Jill should visit the /artRoom/

Look like you can put something on the emblem slot, refresh the previous page


WE THEN INPUT THE OTHER EMBLEM FLAG WE RECIEVED INTO THE NEWLY SHOWN FLAG INPUT PROMPT FOR barRoomHidden.php
and get:

With this encoded text we look at the hint for the next question:
Blaise de Vigen√®re 
Upon further research we discover that he was a French Cryptographer.
Using CyberChef we decode the phrase with the Vignere Cipher using the key 'rebecca'
:
there is a shield key inside the dining room. The html page is called the_great_shield_key

Look like you can put a gem on the tiger's eye

WE ENTER THE blue_jewel FLAG AND GET THE FOLLOWING:
