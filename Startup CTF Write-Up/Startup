We are Spice Hut, a new startup company that just made it big! We offer a variety of spices and club sandwiches (in case you get hungry), but that is not why you are here. 
To be truthful, we aren't sure if our developers know what they are doing and our security concerns are rising.
We ask that you perform a thorough penetration test and try to own root. Good luck!

Whoever is leaving these damn Among Us memes in this share, it IS NOT FUNNY. People downloading documents from our website will think we are a joke! Now I dont know who it is, but Maya is looking pretty sus.

However, it wont let us extract it...

Lets try another avenue....

We can see that the /files directory is the same one that the ftp server uploads to.
WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS!:
1 - UPLOAD A REVERSE SHELL VIA FTP
2 - NAVIGATE TO /FILES DIRECTORY AND EXECUTE IT WHILE A LISTENER IS ON!

1 - HOW TO UPLOAD THE SHELL VIA FTP

Download and save the reverse php shell - shell.php

on the ftp command - put shell.php
WE COULD NOT DO THIS IN THE BASE DIRECTORY BUT WE COULD DO IT IN THE FTP DIRECTORY - MAKE SURE TO TRY ALL DIRECTORIES IN OTHER SITUATIONS

Navigate to 10.10.119.44/files
Click on the /ftp/shell.php file to execute

WE NOW HAVE A SHELL!

ls
We find a file named recipe.txt that contains the following:
Someone asked what our main ingredient to our spice soup is today. I figured I can't keep it a secret forever and told him it was love.

Now we can answer the first question - 
What is the secret spicy soup recipe? = love

Now lets upgrade to a python shell
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'	

We find a directory called Incidents
Inside it we find an interesting file named suspicious.pcapng
