Fuel CMS 1.4
We search for an exploit and find one
https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50477
usage:
python3 exploit.py -u http:/10.10.109.100

we got commands

we downloaded a reverse php shell and edited appropriately
set up a netcat listener
used wget on the exploited machine to grab the shell and then visited the web directory
(remember /var/www/html isnt what you put into the web browser bar, just use the IP address instead:
10.10.109.100/shell.php

it worked!

upgrade to python shell:
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

we grabbed linenum.sh with wget and ran it on our exploited machine and output it into a text file
we then copied this text file to /var/www/html and viewed it in the web browser for easier reading
10.10.109.100/output.txt
no luck with results

Went back to fuel cms web page to check for the database conf path which was described there

cat /var/www/html/fuel/application/config/database.php

got root password
