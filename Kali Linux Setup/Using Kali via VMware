HOW TO CONNECT TO TRYHACKME OPENVPN

Download your openvpn file from access tab on tryhackme 

Copy it over to the kali linux virtual machine

sudo openvpn test.ovpn

You should now be connected to TryHackMe Network

We verify this by deploying a machine and navigating to the website to get a flag.

However we are unable to access the wider internet as a whole on our kali linux vm so we must try and fix this.
