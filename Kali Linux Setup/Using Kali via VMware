HOW TO CONNECT TO TRYHACKME OPENVPN

Download your openvpn file from access tab on tryhackme 

Copy it over to the kali linux virtual machine

sudo openvpn test.ovpn

You should now be connected to TryHackMe Network

We verify this by deploying a machine and navigating to the website to get a flag.



WE WERE HAVING ISSUES CONNECTING TO MACHINES 
So we followed tryhackme help advice
1 - try a different vpn server
2 - redownload your ovpn file
3 - you can verify your connection and your tryhackme/vpn IP at 10.10.10.10
4 - you can also use ifconfig for more info on that
5 - if all else fails restart VM and try all above steps again!

WE ARE NOW ABLE TO CONNECT TO TARGET MACHINES AND WE ARE COMPLETELY SET UP - YAHOO!!!

NOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TURNS OUT WE ACTUALLY CAN USE ANOTHER VPN AT THE SAME TIME AS WELL
