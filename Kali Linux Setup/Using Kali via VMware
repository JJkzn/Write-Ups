HOW TO CONNECT TO TRYHACKME OPENVPN

Download your openvpn file from access tab on tryhackme 

Copy it over to the kali linux virtual machine

sudo openvpn test.ovpn

You should now be connected to TryHackMe Network

We verify this by deploying a machine and navigating to the website to get a flag.

!--- However we are unable to access the wider internet as a whole on our kali linux vm so we must try and fix this. (may be best to keep our virtual machine isolated from the internet to be honest...) --!
NOTE - we are able to access the internet when we disabled our personal vpn that was running outside the virtual machine (oops)



LUCKILY we are able to serve an http server on port 80 - this should be enough to allow us to complete TryHackMe CTFs much easier now that we can do stuff like editing /etc/hosts on compromised machines
to allow us to make their scripts download files from our machine instead :)

WE WERE HAVING ISSUES CONNECTING TO MACHINES 
So we followed tryhackme help advice
1 - try a different vpn server
2 - redownload your ovpn file
3 - you can verify your connection and your tryhackme/vpn IP at 10.10.10.10
4 - you can also use ifconfig for more info on that
5 - if all else fails restart VM and try all above steps again!

WE ARE NOW ABLE TO CONNECT TO TARGET MACHINES AND WE ARE COMPLETELY SET UP - YAHOO!!!

NOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TURNS OUT WE ACTUALLY CAN USE ANOTHER VPN AT THE SAME TIME AS WELL
