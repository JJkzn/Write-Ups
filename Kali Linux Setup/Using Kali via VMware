HOW TO CONNECT TO TRYHACKME OPENVPN

Download your openvpn file from access tab on tryhackme 

Copy it over to the kali linux virtual machine

sudo openvpn test.ovpn

You should now be connected to TryHackMe Network

We verify this by deploying a machine and navigating to the website to get a flag.

!--- However we are unable to access the wider internet as a whole on our kali linux vm so we must try and fix this. (may be best to keep our virtual machine isolated from the internet to be honest...) --!

LUCKILY we are able to serve an http server on port 80 - this should be enough to allow us to complete TryHackMe CTFs much easier now that we can do stuff like editing /etc/hosts on compromised machines
to allow us to make their scripts download files from our machine instead :)
